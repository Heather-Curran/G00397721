 Ionic App for Mobile application


I created this app for the user to be able to search for different video games and add them to a list of favourites. 
The home page displays different video games information such as their title, number of hours to complete, and rating.
The search page allows the user to search for a particular game title. Begin typing the game you are searching for into the search bar and the result will be displayed below. 
The profile page allows the user to add and save information about themselves. To edit this information later, press the edit button at the bottom of the page, change the desired details, and then press save.
The favourites page (not currently working) allows the user to create a list of their favourite video games by pressing the star button on the game card. To unfavourite, you press the star button again.
